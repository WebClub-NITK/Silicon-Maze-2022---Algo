Problem name
ALGO: Stark's GCD Dilemma
Problem statement
Ed Stark is given an array of N positive integers. A1,A2,...An
She can perform the following operation ONLY ONCE on the array
Pick an index i such that 1≤i≤N Now, select some integer x and add it to Ai. Note that Ai should not become negative after this operation. 
Find the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of all the elements of the array after performing the above operation exactly once. 
 
Input Format
The first line of each test case contains N - The number of integers in the array A
The second line contains N space separated integers A1A2A3...An.
 
Output Format
For every test case, print a single line containing the maximum possible GCD of all the elements of the array. 
 
Constraints
2≤N≤2×105
1≤Ai≤109
