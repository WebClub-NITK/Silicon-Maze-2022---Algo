It can be observed that two vertices of a diamond are on the same row, and two are on the same column. 

For each row, count the number of diamonds that have two of its vertices on the same row, and sum up the answers.

First, count the number of white cells in a row (call it w). Suppose you selected two consecutive white cells (two white cells separated by a black cell) in row number i. You can select (w - 1) such pairs. A diamond is formed by selecting the appropriate white cell on the row (i - 1) and (i + 1). Similarly, for two white cells with two black cells in between (there are w - 2 such pairs), a diamond is formed by selecting a white cell on the row (i - 2) and (i + 2). The process continues till min(i - 1, n - row), call it s.

Thus, the answer for a row = (w - 1) + (w - 2) + â€¦ (w - s), which can be calculated in O(1) since it is the sum of an arithmetic progression.
